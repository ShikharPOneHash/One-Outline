If you'd like to run your own copy of One-Outline or contribute to development then this is the place for you.

# Installation

Please see the [documentation](https://docs.getoutline.com/s/hosting/) for running your own copy of One-Outline in a production configuration.

# Development

There is a short guide for [setting up a development environment](https://docs.getoutline.com/s/hosting/doc/local-development-5hEhFRXow7) 


HTTP logging is disabled by default, but can be enabled by setting the `DEBUG=http` environment variable.

## Tests

We aim to have sufficient test coverage for critical parts of the application and aren't aiming for 100% unit test coverage. All API endpoints and anything authentication related should be thoroughly tested.

To add new tests, write your tests with [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and add a file with `.test.js` extension next to the tested code.

```shell
# To run all tests
make test

# To run backend tests in watch mode
make watch
```

Once the test database is created with `make test` you may individually run
frontend and backend tests directly.

```shell
# To run backend tests
yarn test:server

# To run a specific backend test
yarn test:server myTestFile

# To run frontend tests
yarn test:app
```

## Migrations

Sequelize is used to create and run migrations, for example:

```shell
yarn sequelize migration:generate --name my-migration
yarn sequelize db:migrate
```

Or to run migrations on test database:

```shell
yarn sequelize db:migrate --env test
```
